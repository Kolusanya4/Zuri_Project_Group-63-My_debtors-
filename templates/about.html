                <p>My Debtors was established with the intention of serving as a link between different schools and their owing students in order to accomplish the goals of saving schools from admitting student debtors and assisting students in keeping track of how much they owe.
                   </p><br>
                   <p> According to a study done in December 2020, 75% of students dropped out of more than 3500 schools because they couldn't track their payment status and some weren't even aware.
                    </p><br>
                   <p> By keeping schools informed of their payment status, we have also assisted them in managing their cash flow and boosted student confidence.
                    </p><br>
                   <p> At My Debtors, we think that no school should have to close because of student debt.

            <div class="p">
                <p>Our vision is to build a safe and welcoming platform for all our users (schools and parents), where nobody will be judged but fully accepted. We strive to create better and easier methods of accessing our platform and also ensure parties involved are satisfied throughout the transaction process.</p><br>
                   <p> As we move towards our goal of being a world-class platform, we will ensure that nothing but excellence will be delivered. We strongly believe that by 2030, cases of students debts causing the shutdown of schools will be reduced and the knowledge of parents being aware of how much they owe will be increased.</p><br>
                   <p> We have so far resolved over 1,670 instances with schools smiling and being able to recover every penny of both new and old debts thanks to our great willingness to assist both schools and student. </p><br>
